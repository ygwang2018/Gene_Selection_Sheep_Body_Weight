# Gene_Selection_Sheep_Body_Weight
A modified memetic algorithm with an application to gene selection in a sheep body weight study

Selecting the minimal best subset out of a huge number of factors for influencing the response is a fundamental and very challenging problem. We propose a modified memetic algorithm (MA) based on an improved splicing method to improve the traditional genetic algorithm's exploitation capability and reduction in subset sizes. The new algorithm accelerates search in identifying the minimal best subset of genes. The new local search operator, together with the improved splicing method, can limit the size of gene subsets and recover true subsets of genes with a high probability. Moreover, the mutation operator is replaced by the improved splicing method to enhance exploitation capability and enhance efficiency of search. A dataset of three kinds of body weight of Hu sheep is investigated to demonstrate the superiority of the modified MA. According to our experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including the most advanced adaptive best-subset selection algorithm.
